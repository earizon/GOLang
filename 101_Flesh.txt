## Flesh

* <https://github.com/gravityblast/fresh>
  Fresh is a command line tool that builds and (re)starts your web
  application everytime you save a Go or template file.
   If the web framework you are using supports the Fresh runner,
  it will show build errors on your browser.
   It currently works with Traffic, Martini and gocraft/web.
  ```
  | $ go get github.com/pilu/fresh # Installation
  | $ cd /path/to/myapp            # Ussage
  | $ Start fresh
  ```

* It will watch for file events, and every time you
  create/modify/delete a file it will build and restart the
  application. If go build returns an error, it will log it in the tmp
  folder.
