# sqlc  [[{persistence.sql]]
https://sqlc.dev/
sqlc generates type-safe code from SQL. Here's how it works:

* I used to use https://github.com/volatiletech/sqlboiler,
but now I use https://github.com/ent/ent which has in my opinion
surpassed it in a very short time by adding a ton of useful features
and having a great documentation.

 You write queries in SQL.
 You run sqlc to generate code with type-safe interfaces to those queries.
 You write application code that calls the generated code.
